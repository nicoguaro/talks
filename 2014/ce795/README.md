CE597-slides
============

This is the repo for the slides for a couple of lectures that I will give in
the class CE597 Advanced Topics in Classical and Computational Solid Mechanics
at Purdue University.

Slides:

- [First lecture (Deduction of wave equations in elasticity)](./CE597-slides.pdf?raw=true),
  and  (almost) the same material can be downloaded
  [here](./Waves.pdf?raw=true) as a single document.

- [Second lecture (Numerical methods for wave propagation)](./CE597-numerical.pdf?raw=true).
  There is an IPython Notebook for this lecture [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nicoguaro/talks/blob/master/2014/ce795/CFL_Nyquist_conditions.ipynb)
